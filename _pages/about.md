I am a recent graduate from London Metropolitan University, graduating First Class with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology. My academic and research journey has been driven by a passion for statistical analysis, programming, and neuroscience. I have experience in programming and coducting analysis using Python, R, and SPSS.

I am currently a Machine Learning intern in the Department of Information Studies at University College London (UCL), selected to work on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool for Question Answering (QA) using BERT model within the Parkinson's disease.
